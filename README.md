# Python WSGI Examples

A starter project for Clark's Databases course (CSCI 220). This project includes a web server and database.

**WARNING**: These examples are intended to illustrate the basics of web application programming. The examples are vulnerabile to attacks like [cross site scripting](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html). Eventually, we will introduce frameworks like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) which [incorporate protections against many common attacks](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/security/).

Follow these steps to get started:

## Step 0: Clone This Repository

Unless otherwise specified, all commands mentioned below should be run within the root directory of this repository.

## Step 1: Install Docker

This project includes several components: 

- uWSGI, which will run your Python code
- NGINX, a web server which will allow browsers to communicate with uWSGI
- PostgresSQL, a database which will store your application's persistent data

It could be time-consuming to install and configure all of these on your computer, but thankfully there is a better way: Docker! [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and it will be easy to run all of these components.

## Step 2: Configure Database Password

It is a terrible idea to run software with default passwords. To configure the password for the database, you will need to write them in a `.env` file. Follow these steps:

1. Copy `dot_env_example` to `.env`
2. Run `chmod 600 .env` to prevent other users from reading your `.env` file
3. Edit `.env`, changing the text `RANDOM_PASSWORD` to a password which is actually random

## Step 3: Start the Docker Services

Run:
```
docker compose up
```

The first time you run it, this command will take a few minutes to complete. This is because Docker needs to download the code for PostgresSQL, etc.

When you are done running the application, you can stop it by typing `Control-C`.

## Step 4: Load the Application

Load <http://localhost> and you should see "Hello World".

## Step 5: Running a Different Application

To run an application other than `hello_world.py`, simply edit `UWSGI_FILE` in your `.env`.

### Hints

- Each time you edit your code, you will need to restart the `uwsgi` service. You can do this by either interrupting `docker compose up` by typing `Control-C`, or you can simply restart `uwsgi` with `docker compose restart uwsgi`.
- Print statements and fatal exceptions will be logged to the `uwsgi.log` file. Refer to this file when debugging your code.
- If you want to add CSS files or other static resources, you should store them in the `/static` directory. The `nginx` service will serve these resources.
- To interactively run SQL commands, run:

```
> docker compose exec postgres bash
# psql --username="$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname="$POSTGRES_DB"
```

- To execute SQL commands from a file, run:

```
> docker compose exec postgres bash
# psql --username="$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname="$POSTGRES_DB" --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on --file /postgres_files/db_dump.DATE.sql
```

- To dump the SQL commands needed to recreate a database to file, run:

```
> docker compose exec postgres bash
# pg_dump --username="$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname="$POSTGRES_DB" --file=/postgres_files/db_dump.DATE.sql
```
